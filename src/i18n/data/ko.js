Since then, computers have gradually developed into an industry and profoundly changed our lives.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'In 1981, the famous physicist Feynman observed many difficulties encountered by ordinary computers based on the Turing model in simulating quantum mechanical systems, and then proposed the idea of classical computers simulating quantum systems. When quantum physics and computing machines met in a narrow way, in 1985, the concept of universal quantum computers was finally born.\n' +

          'Since then, quantum mechanics has entered the process of rapid transformation into real social technology, and human beings have moved faster and faster on the road of quantum computing application development. Nowadays, quantum computing is no longer far away from us.\n' +

          'From classical computing to quantum computing\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Generally speaking, quantum computing is a new computing model that follows the laws of quantum mechanics to regulate quantum information units for computing. It is completely different from existing computing models. When understanding the concept of quantum computing, it is usually compared with classical computing.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'In classic computers, the basic unit of information is Bit. All the things that these computers do can be decomposed into 0s and 1s patterns, and simple operations of 0s and 1s.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Similar to the way traditional computers are composed of bits, quantum computers are composed of quantum bits or qubits, and a qubit corresponds to a state. However, the state of a bit is a number (0 or 1), while the state of a qubit is a vector. More specifically, the state of the qubit is a vector in a two-dimensional vector space. This vector space is called the state space.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Classical calculations use binary digital electronic methods to perform operations, and binary is always in a certain state of 0 or 1. Therefore, quantum computing can realize the superposition of computing states with the help of the superposition property of quantum mechanics. That is, it not only contains 0 and 1, but also contains the superposition of 0 and 1 at the same time.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'A 2-bit register in an ordinary computer can only store one binary number (one of 00, 01, 10, 11) at a time, while a 2-bit qubit register in a quantum computer can maintain the superposition of all 4 states at the same time. When the number of qubits is n, the quantum processor performing one operation on n qubits is equivalent to performing 2n operations on the classical bits. \n' +

          'How many possibilities are there in quantum computing?\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of subatomic particles. The use of mysterious quantum mechanics of quantum computers has surpassed the characteristics of the limits of classical Newtonian physics. It has become the scientific and technological community for a long time to achieve exponential growth in computing power. dream.\n' +
          'Quantum computing provides attractive possibilities for future scientific and technological development. Researchers trying to use the power of this new hardware mainly start with three types of problems.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The first type of problem involves analyzing the natural world: using quantum computers to simulate the behavior of molecules with precision that today’s computers cannot match. Among them, computational chemistry is the largest application field. In fact, in the past two years, the value of quantum computers in replacing guesswork with more and more empirical evidence has increased.\n' +
          '  \n' +
          'For example, simulating a relatively basic molecule (such as caffeine) would require a traditional computer with 10 to 48 bits, which is equivalent to 10% of the number of atoms on the earth. The analog penicillin requires 10 to the 86th power of bits-this number is greater than the total number of atoms in the observable universe.\n' +

          'Traditional computers will never be able to handle such tasks, but in the quantum field, such calculations are possible. In theory, a quantum computer with 160 qubits can simulate caffeine, while simulating penicillin requires 286 qubits. This provides a more convenient means for designing new materials or finding better ways to deal with existing processes.\n' +

          'On August 27th, the Google quantum research team announced that it had simulated the largest chemical reaction to date on a quantum computer. Related results appeared on the cover of "Science" magazine, entitled "Hartree-Fock on a Superconducting Qubit Quantum Computer" .\n' +

In the end, the quantum simulation was consistent with the simulation performed by the researchers on a classical computer, verifying their work.\n' +

Although this kind of chemical reaction may be relatively simple and is not something that a non-quantum computer can do, it shows the great potential of using quantum simulation to develop new chemical substances.\n' +

          'In addition, quantum computing is also expected to bring more benefits to artificial intelligence. Currently, potential applications of quantum algorithms for artificial intelligence include quantum neural networks, natural language processing, traffic optimization, and image processing. Among them, quantum neural network, as a research field formed by the intersection of quantum science, information science, and cognitive science, can use the powerful computing power of quantum computing to improve the information processing ability of neural computing.\n' +

This is the first successful verification of quantum natural language processing applications worldwide. Researchers use the "intrinsic quantum" structure of natural language to translate sentences with grammar into quantum circuits, realize the process of program processing on quantum computers, and get answers to questions in sentences. The use of quantum computing is expected to achieve a further breakthrough in "semantic perception" in natural language processing.\n' +

For example, one use of quantum computing on complex issues is to build better financial market models. Enhancing encryption by inventing new numbers and improving operational efficiency in chaotic and complex areas such as transaction clearing and reconciliation. Including the pricing of derivatives, the optimization of investment portfolios, and the management of risks in highly complex and constantly changing circumstances, quantum systems can all handle things.'

          'Face recognition technology is currently recognized as a relatively mature technology in the AI ​​field. People in the circle are also keen to brush up the accuracy of face recognition to new highs, the highest claimed accuracy rate can reach 99.9%. Face recognition technology has such a brilliant record, why is this AI editor still blind?\n' +
          '\n' +
          '"The working principle of face recognition technology is mainly to compare the facial features and facial features." Professor Han Yahong of the Department of Intelligence and Computing at Tianjin University explained. Simply put, it is based on the big data of the face image. Preprocessing is performed to extract features of various aspects of the face, and multiple extractions are carried out by layering to find the most effective feature expression for identifying individual faces.\n' +
          '\n' +
          ' Face recognition technology has undergone major changes over the years, and traditional face recognition methods have been replaced by deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks. The main advantage of deep learning methods is that they can be trained on large-scale data sets to learn the best features of these data.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '"Although you can use large-scale data sets for training, the current accuracy of 99.9% is basically the result of testing on some benchmark data sets. This data set must have a range, if the collected data is in the data set Within the range of distribution, a relatively high accuracy rate can be obtained." Han Yahong said.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'It is understood that the current claim that the accuracy of face recognition has reached more than 99% refers to the results of the comparison test with the world\'s most authoritative face database LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild). LFW can be regarded as a question bank for testing the face recognition capabilities of deep learning systems. It extracts 6000 face photos with different orientations, expressions and lighting environments from the Internet as test questions, allowing any system to "run points" in it. The "run score" process is that LFW gives a pair of photos and asks the test system if the two photos are the same person, and the system gives a yes or no answer.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '"It is not difficult to solve the specific face blindness problem. In fact, it is to re-target the task, collect the face images in the task field, train on the original algorithm model, or redesign the new algorithm model for training, will improve face recognition To meet the needs of practical applications.” Han Yahong said, but beyond the specific task, AI’s “face blindness” will recur. At present, there is no general model algorithm that can solve all tasks, but AI can improve the accuracy of face recognition through continuous adjustment and a lot of learning.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Deep neural network model is a necessary condition for advanced\n' +
          '\n' +
          '"At present, AI editors are relatively handy in analyzing and processing news documents." Han Yahong said, specifically, for example, in a very long report, let the AI ​​editor pick out the key points, which is no problem. Now is the era of multimedia, a large number of news reports will involve pictures and videos. AI editors can automatically extract pictures or videos, and then select text descriptions that match them from large-length text reports. This work AI is comparable Do it accurately.\n' +
          '\n' +
          ' "To solve problems in specific fields, AI is usually no problem, but it is more difficult to achieve generalization." Han Yahong emphasized that realizing these functions requires technologies in fields such as natural language processing, pattern recognition, image and video understanding.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'To train an AI editor, you first need to collect a lot of news reports, pictures and videos, and then design a deep neural network model for this task based on the collected data. There will be many parameters in the network model, and then the parameters are trained through the data. , It has all the editing capabilities originally set. In the use process, as the AI ​​editor learns more news, its business capabilities and performance will continue to improve.'

        text3: 'Experts predict that AI, along with powering the world’s future economic base, will revolutionize the future battlespace by enabling machines to act without human supervision, process and interpret massive amounts of data, and enhance the command and control of warfare. With the stakes being economic and military supremacy and control of technologies that can be applied for social control, the U.S. has moved to counter the PRC threat and maintain its AI dominance.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '“If you look at industry output, if you look at the leading academic institutions that are leading the way and advancing the state of the art and AI, they’re American industries and they’re American academics,” Lynne Parker, the White House coordinator on AI policy, told Politico, a U.S. political journalism website, in July 2019.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '“We’re clearly producing the most impactful commercial products. And certainly, that’s not to say that the rest of the world isn’t waking up to the great opportunities of AI — but clearly, the United States is in the lead.”\n' +
          '   \n' +
          'A study released in August 2019 by the Center for Data Innovation (CDI), a global think tank based in Washington, D.C., confirmed U.S. leadership in AI in talent, research, development and hardware, among other parameters.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '“Despite China’s bold AI initiative, the United States still leads in absolute terms; China comes in second, and the European Union lags further behind,” said the 106-page report, titled “Who is Winning the AI Race: China, the EU or the United States?\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The PRC’s State Council released a strategic plan in 2017 to rival the U.S. in AI by 2020 and assume world leadership in AI technology by 2025, although the plan didn’t specify what such leadership might look like. The CDI report found China trails the U.S. in many metrics despite the PRC’s plan to invest U.S. $150 billion in AI by 2030, as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Made-in-China push.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The U.S. “has the most AI start-ups, with its AI start-up ecosystem having received the most private equity and venture capital funding,” the CDI report said. The U.S. “leads in the development of both traditional semiconductors and the computer chips that power AI systems; while it produces fewer AI scholarly papers than the EU or China, it produces the highest-quality papers on average.” The PRC still lags behind on most metrics, especially on a per capita basis.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Moreover, the U.S. has the leading AI talent in the world, although the EU has access to more AI talent, the report found. The PRC lags behind both the U.S. and EU in talent.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The PRC has collected more civilian data than the U.S. and EU, and its population is adopting AI more rapidly, according to the report. However, its policies such as civil-military integration will hinder its success in the global market because the PRC’s practices foster distrust in other societies, the report said.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has also been investing in AI, especially for military purposes. However, its efforts trail the rest of the world because it has failed to establish the required culture of innovation, according to analysts. Putin openly asserted “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” Ironically, many of Russia’s leading innovators have fled Russia for the U.S. and Europe, according to a June 2019 report by the website Defense One.'

        text3: 'FORUM: What are your impressions of the U.S. artificial intelligence strategy?\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Castro: This administration’s efforts are starting to gain steam. The executive order has kicked off a series of actions that will lead toward meaningful improvements in how the federal government lays the foundations for future work on AI. In addition, the recent [September 2019] White House AI summit was an important catalyzing event to spur enthusiasm and momentum across federal agencies to pursue their own AI efforts independently. As the administration makes it clear that there is top-level support for this work, more people in government will start making this a priority. Also creating AI.gov will help.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'FORUM: How do you think the U.S. strategy could be expanded?\n' +
          '   \n' +
          'Castro: There is always more work to be done. One area is funding. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to get a clear sense of how much some other governments are pouring into AI R&D, yet it is substantial. Congress needs to prioritize additional funding to supplement what the private sector provides and the “business as usual” funding it already offers to computer science and related disciplines. There is also a need to better track this funding across different agencies, particularly in relation to the various AI R&D priorities that the administration has identified. A lot of R&D on AI will not come from the National Science Foundation, but from the Department of Energy, Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation and other federal agencies. In addition, the U.S. government should consider joint funding initiatives with allies around the globe to foster research collaboration.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'FORUM: How important is the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) to U.S. competitiveness in AI?\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Castro: The JAIC will be especially important in the near-term as a lack of talent in the Defense Department [DOD] constrains what defense agencies can do with AI. By consolidating expertise, DOD can better prioritize projects, focus on solving scaling issues, and develop a culture of AI-driven innovation within DOD.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'FORUM: What is the bottom line of your recent report from the Center for Data Innovation?\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Castro: The U.S. has an early lead in artificial intelligence, but China is gaining fast, and if the U.S. does not commit the resources necessary to compete, it will squander its early lead. The implications of falling behind in AI could have seriously negative implications for the U.S. economy, national security, and overall global competitiveness. Many other countries are making AI a priority, and the U.S. needs to do so as well.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'FORUM: Are most people aware that the U.S. still leads China in absolute terms? Were your findings surprising in any way?\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Castro: Although it’s important to note that this is a snapshot, and while we are using the most recent data, some of it is still about a year out of date. And even over the past few years, we have seen China making significant strides forward, so the gap between the countries is narrowing quickly. Moreover, both the U.S. and China have a lot of focus on using AI in the military, and much of that work cannot be publicly compared.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'But one of the most significant factors is that China leads in adoption of AI, especially around piloting the technology. And public polls show that Chinese citizens generally are optimistic about AI. So, China has the wind at its back as it pursues ever more ambitious AI initiatives. In contrast, the U.S. public is more pessimistic about the potential of AI, which likely limits the willingness of lawmakers to pursue the technology.'

        text3: 'For decades, amateur two-way radio operators have chosen the right radio frequency at the right time of day in order to communicate across continents. The luxury to do this is because there are relatively few users and devices that share radio waves. But with the popularity of cellular radios in phones and Internet of Things devices, it becomes increasingly difficult to find interference-free frequencies.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Therefore, the researchers plan to use deep learning to create cognitive radios, which can be adjusted immediately to obtain the best performance.\n' +

          'A given radio frequency range can be shared by one hundred small radio devices designed to work in the same overall area. Each small radio device has its own signaling characteristics and can adapt to changing conditions. . When predicting which spectrum fragments are available at a given moment, such a large number of devices reduces the power of the fixed mathematical model.\n' +

          'Early studies have shown that the classification accuracy of deep learning models is 20% higher than traditional systems on average when dealing with noisy radio channels, and can be extended to hundreds of devices running simultaneously, not just dozens. In addition, the deep learning architecture developed for this purpose will also be used for many other tasks.\n' +

Loyal customers of the ski resort (for example, those who purchase annual ski passes) can also obtain shares in the company.\n' +
          'The fate of other local commercial organizations, and even housing prices, are closely linked to the success of this resort. The purpose of their issuance of digital shares is to establish closer ties with the local community, and to attract more repeat customers by allowing customers to share profits and participate in future strategies.\n' +
          'Exploring the technology of Bitcoin and blockchain\n' +
          'This content was published on April 22, 2019, April 22, 2019  Some people think this is just hype; others see this as a revolutionary technology that can completely change the way we trade almost everything of value. So what exactly is this so-called distributed ledger technology (DLT)? How does it work? Who can benefit from it? In the video below, we will distinguish between fact and fiction for you and help you see the smoke screen of hype. \n' +
          'The secret weapon of DLT platform (such as blockchain) is to allow a group of people to safely share data (whether it is money, financial instruments, or personal information) directly.\n' +
          'This digital system avoids paying middlemen to act as audits and referees between the parties to the transaction, but allows users to jointly negotiate the validity of the data. This guarantees the immediacy of settlement (no longer needs several days) and reduces costs. Weisse Arena Gruppe is issuing shares through the Daura (English) share registration platform, which is supported by the DLT system of the telecom giant Swisscom (Multilingual). The so-called "encrypted shares" are embedded with a kind of "smart contract", that is, a computer code that can replace the functions of brokers, custodian banks, and other intermediaries when buying and selling. This allows sellers and buyers to have direct contact, enabling instant peer-to-peer transactions.\n' +
          'The ski resort also plans to issue its own cryptocurrency GURU (Greatest User Return Unit), which is personal money that can be used in this resort. If guests exchange Swiss francs for GURU to pay, they can enjoy discounts at restaurants or other facilities in the resort.\n' +
          'People\'s interest in DLT goes beyond interest in the ski resort itself.\n' +
          'Blockchain real estate\n' +
          'In March of this year, 20% of the assets of a building in the Swiss town of Zug were converted into digital shares. Through a blockchain platform, four investors bought these shares for 3 million Swiss francs. This is the first digital operation and transaction of property assets in Switzerland, and perhaps others will follow suit in the near future.\n' +
          'The digital token representing the ownership of this property was issued through the blockimmo (English) platform. Elea Labs (English) has ensured that these real estate data are true and valid. In the execution of this transaction, a cryptocurrency linked to the Swiss franc at a 1:1 ratio was used, and the cryptocurrency was issued by Swiss Crypto Tokens (English). This so-called "stable currency" can avoid the dramatic price fluctuations associated with other cryptocurrencies.\n' +
          'Many tasks currently performed by intermediaries (lawyers, notaries, etc.) can be replaced by "smart contracts", which can make transactions faster or make rental income distributed to dividends faster. Another advantage is that since the digital shares of real estate can be easily divided into smaller shares, investors with less capital can also join in real estate investment.\n' +
          'For the ownership of a property, the blockchain can provide all participants with a historical record arranged in chronological order, and the real-time update of the record will only take effect when all parties to the transaction agree. At present, the Swiss law is making corresponding adjustments to recognize transactions that only have digital stocks in the absence of handwritten signatures.\n' +
          'Paperwork terminator\n' +
          'Starting a company requires a lot of paperwork and a large number of third-party agencies to approve each stage of the process.

          'In a trial last year, they completed the creation of the first company Drakkensberg within two hours. To a large extent, this is due to their special agreement with the bank to speed up financial transactions, but even without this arrangement, they can complete the creation of other companies within 48 hours.\n' +

          'Blockchain technology can avoid a large amount of paperwork that goes back and forth between many law firms and banks. It is no longer necessary to wait for the completion of each registration process. Blockchain provides all participants with a complete overview of the entire process, making the process Multiple steps in can be performed simultaneously.\n' +
          'They ambitiously set a goal of establishing 100,000 companies by the end of August. At present, the lawyers participating in the trial have paid their working hours without pay. Therefore, one of their goals is to transform this process into permanent commercial services.\n' +

An ordinary sea freight can produce a total of 240 documents, including 36 original documents, distributed among 27 intermediaries.\n' +
          'The DLT network uses algorithms to enable transaction parties to reach an agreement on the validity of data without the need for intermediaries. If the parties to a transaction hold identical copies of the same data, they can immediately agree on this, which speeds up the process and avoids disputes in the future.\n' +

          'When the artificial intelligence applied in the news field has a level of cognition that surpasses that of journalists, it will definitely have a subversive impact on the current laws and regulations related to journalism and news ethics.\n' +
          '1. Improve corresponding laws and regulations\n' +
          'Due to its advantages in policies and resources, the government should actively take the responsibility of promoting the improvement of laws and regulations related to the application of artificial intelligence, and guide the application of artificial intelligence on a reasonable and scientific path. It is specifically implemented in the news field, and a series of disputes and definitions of artificial intelligence are explained in detail.\n' +
          '2. Improve the social responsibility of AI owners\n' +
          'The development of artificial intelligence should not only rely on government support and intervention. Large companies such as Google and Facebook have strong financial and technical support and are also the main use of artificial intelligence technology. Such companies should consciously abide by the law, use artificial intelligence rationally, and shoulder the responsibilities of large companies.\n' +
          '3. Promote AI education and learning for all\n' +
          'The United States clearly proposes to increase "AI education for all," and China should also have such an international vision and sense of competition. Human resources are the first resource. Winning talents will win a favorable position in the new development period and new stage of competition. Domestic colleges and universities can set up relevant courses and invite industry talents to give lectures to cultivate reserve forces for artificial intelligence.'

          'But the vagueness of the principles announced by the White House is unlikely to satisfy AI watchdogs who have warned of a lack of accountability as computer systems are deployed to take on human roles in high-risk social settings, such as mortgage lending or job recruitment.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The White House said that in deciding regulatory action, U.S. agencies “must consider fairness, non-discrimination, openness, transparency, safety, and security.” But federal agencies must also avoid setting up restrictions that “needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth,” reads a memo being sent to U.S. agency chiefs from Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n' +
          '   \n' +
          '“Agencies must avoid a precautionary approach that holds AI systems to such an impossibly high standard that society cannot enjoy their benefits,” the memo says.\n' +

          '\n' +
          '“These principles are intentionally high-level,” said Lynne Parker, U.S. deputy chief technology officer at the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. “We purposely wanted to avoid top-down, one-size-fits-all, blanket regulations.”\n' +

          '\n' +
          'The past decade will be remembered as the time when machines that can truly be thought of as “intelligent” – as in capable of thinking, and learning, like we do – started to become a reality outside of science fiction.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'While no prediction engine has yet been built that can plot the course of AI over the coming decade, we can be fairly certain about what might happen over the next year. Spending on research, development, and deployment continues to rise, and debate over the wider social implications rages on. Meanwhile, the incentives only get bigger for those looking to roll out AI-driven innovation into new areas of industry, fields of science, and our day-to-day lives.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Here are my predictions for what we\'re likely to see continue or emerge in the first year of the 2020s.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '\n' +
          '1. AI will increasingly be monitoring and refining business processes\n' +
          '\n' +
          'While the first robots in the workplace were mainly involved with automating manual tasks such as manufacturing and production lines, today\'s software-based robots will take on the repetitive but necessary work that we carry out on computers. Filling in forms, generating reports and diagrams and producing documentation and instructions are all tasks that can be automated by machines that watch what we do and learn to do it for us in a quicker and more streamlined manner. This automation – known as robotic process automation – will free us from the drudgery of time-consuming but essential administrative work, leaving us to spend more time on complex, strategic, creative and interpersonal tasks.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '2. More and more personalization will take place in real-time\n' +
          '\n' +
          'This trend is driven by the success of internet giants like Amazon, Alibaba, and Google, and their ability to deliver personalized experiences and recommendations. AI allows providers of goods and services to quickly and accurately project a 360-degree view of customers in real-time as they interact through online portals and mobile apps, quickly learning how their predictions can fit our wants and needs with ever-increasing accuracy. Just as pizza delivery companies like Dominos will learn when we are most likely to want pizza, and make sure the "Order Now" button is in front of us at the right time, every other industry will roll out solutions aimed at offering personalized customer experiences at scale.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '3. AI becomes increasingly useful as data becomes more accurate and available\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The quality of information available is often a barrier to businesses and organizations wanting to move towards AI-driven automated decision-making. But as technology and methods of simulating real-world processes and mechanisms in the digital domain have improved over recent years, accurate data has become increasingly available. Simulations have advanced to the stage where car manufacturers and others working on the development of autonomous vehicles can gain thousands of hours of driving data without vehicles even leaving the lab, leading to huge reductions in cost as well as increases in the quality of data that can be gathered. Why risk the expense and danger of testing AI systems in the real world when computers are now powerful enough, and trained on accurate-enough data, to simulate it all in the digital world? 2020 will see an increase in the accuracy and availability of real-world simulations, which in turn will lead to more powerful and accurate AI.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '4. More devices will run AI-powered technology\n' +
          '\n' +
          'As the hardware and expertise needed to deploy AI become cheaper and more available, we will start to see it used in an increasing number of tools, gadgets, and devices. In 2019 we’re already used to running apps that give us AI-powered predictions on our computers, phones, and watches. As the next decade approaches and the cost of hardware and software continues to fall, AI tools will increasingly be embedded into our vehicles, household appliances, and workplace tools. Augmented by technology such as virtual and augmented reality displays, and paradigms like the cloud and Internet of Things, the next year will see more and more devices of every shape and size starting to think and learn for themselves. \n' +
          '\n' +
          '5. Human and AI cooperation increases\n' +
          '\n' +
          'More and more of us will get used to the idea of working alongside AI-powered tools and bots in our day-to-day working lives. Increasingly, tools will be built that allow us to make the most of our human skills – those which AI can\'t quite manage yet – such as imaginative, design, strategy, and communication skills. While augmenting them with super-fast analytics abilities fed by vast datasets that are updated in real-time.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'For many of us, this will mean learning new skills, or at least new ways to use our skills alongside these new robotic and software-based tools. The IDC predicts that by 2025, 75% of organizations will be investing in employee retraining in order to fill skill gaps caused by the need to adopt AI. This trend will become increasingly apparent throughout 2020, to the point where if your employer isn’t investing in AI tools and training, it might be worth considering how well placed they are to grow over the coming years.  \n' +
          '\n' +
          '6. AI increasingly at the “edge”\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Much of the AI we’re used to interacting with now in our day-to-day lives takes place “in the cloud” – when we search on Google or flick through recommendations on Netflix, the complex, data-driven algorithms run on high-powered processors inside remote data centers, with the devices in our hands or on our desktops simply acting as conduits for information to pass through.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Increasingly, however, as these algorithms become more efficient and capable of running on low-power devices, AI is taking place at the "edge," close to the point where data is gathered and used. This paradigm will continue to become more popular in 2020 and beyond, making AI-powered insights a reality outside of the times and places where super-fast fiber optic and mobile networks are available. Custom processors designed to carry out real-time analytics on-the-fly will increasingly become part of the technology we interact with day-to-day, and increasingly we will be able to do this even if we have patchy or non-existent internet connections.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '7. AI increasingly used to create films, music, and games\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Some things, even in 2020, are probably still best left to humans. Anyone who has seen the current state-of-the-art in AI-generated music, poetry or storytelling is likely to agree that the most sophisticated machines still have some way to go until their output will be as enjoyable to us as the best that humans can produce. However, the influence of AI on entertainment media is likely to increase. This year we saw Robert De Niro de-aged in front of our eyes with the assistance of AI, in Martin Scorsese’s epic The Irishman, and the use of AI in creating brand new visual effects and trickery is likely to become increasingly common.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'In videogames, AI will continue to be used to create challenging, human-like opponents for players to compete against, as well as to dynamically adjust gameplay and difficulty so that games can continue to offer a compelling challenge for gamers of all skill levels. And while completely AI-generated music may not be everyone’s cup of tea, where AI does excel is in creating dynamic soundscapes – think of smart playlists on services like Spotify or Google Music that match tunes and tempo to the mood and pace of our everyday lives.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '8. AI will become ever more present in cybersecurity\n' +
          '\n' +
          'As hacking, phishing and social engineering attacks become ever-more sophisticated, and themselves powered by AI and advanced prediction algorithms, smart technology will play an increasingly important role in protecting us from these attempted intrusions into our lives. AI can be used to spot giveaway signs that digital activity or transactions follow patterns that are likely to be indicators of nefarious activity, and raise alarms before defenses can be breached and sensitive data compromised.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'The rollout of 5G and other super-fast wireless communications technology will bring huge opportunities for businesses to provide services in new and innovative ways, but they will also potentially open us up to more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Spending on cybersecurity will continue to increase, and those with relevant skills will be highly sought-after.\n' +
          '\n' +
          '9. More of us will interact with AI, maybe without even knowing it\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Let’s face it, despite the huge investment in recent years in natural-language powered chatbots in customer service, most of us can recognize whether we’re dealing with a robot or a human. However, as the datasets used to train natural language processing algorithms continue to grow, the line between humans and machines will become harder and harder to distinguish. With the advent of deep learning and semi-supervised models of machine learning such as reinforcement learning, the algorithms that attempt to match our speech patterns and infer meaning from our own human language will become more and more able to fool us into thinking there is a human on the other end of the conversation. And while many of us may think we would rather deal with a human when looking for information or assistance, if robots fill their promise of becoming more efficient and accurate at interpreting our questions, that could change. Given the ongoing investment and maturation of the technology powering customer service bots and portals, 2020 could be the first time many of us interact with a robot without even realizing it. \n' +
          '\n' +
          '10. But AI will recognize us, even if we don’t recognize it\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Perhaps even more unsettlingly, the rollout of facial recognition technology is only likely to intensify as we move into the next decade. Not just in China (where the government is looking at ways of making facial recognition compulsory for accessing services like communication networks and public transport) but around the world. Corporations and governments are increasingly investing in these methods of telling who we are and interpreting our activity and behavior. There\'s some pushback against this – this year, San Francisco became the first major city to ban the use of facial recognition technology by the police and municipal agencies, and others are likely to follow in 2020. But the question of whether people will ultimately begin to accept this intrusion into their lives, in return for the increased security and convenience it will bring, is likely to be a hotly debated topic of the next 12 months.'

          'Voice assistants are playing a more and more important role in business running. Their challenge is to understand human language, but it’s even harder to understand humans.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'That’s why artificial intelligence exists. AI system engineers can build those voice assistants, but they cannot embed too many human attributes into them in the release. So, AI systems require extensive use of machine learning to enable them to better complete the highly complex task of human-machine interfaces. With the help of AI, voice assistants are more and more capable of searching the internet to help people shopping and provide navigation. Voice technology is expected to play a vital role in home assistants such as taking care of people. It is one of the countless examples of AI voice recognition.\n' +

          '\n' +
          'The key driving force of AI development is the main social media networks. In particular, Facebook seems to have adopted all aspects of artificial intelligence. For example, its algorithm defines a user’s timeline and decides whether to show certain posts of his friends or not. Facebook knows that if all friends post of a user is shown, the timeline will be so messy that it will be boring. As a result, the timeline algorithm can learn about who the user is interacting with the people they usually ignore. \n' +
          '\n' +
          'For Facebook, the most important thing is that social networks use AI to help personalize the way they offer ads to users, so it has a certain ad display correlations. It should be noted that Facebook allows users to comment on the correlation between ads and the timeline. Each user comment helps the system learn and become finer. Due to the way they use AI to fine-tune the display system, Facebook and Google possess an extremely high percentage of the entire online advertising market.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Furthermore, Facebook uses artificial intelligence technology to identify faces in photos, so it can invite users to tag it. Not surprisingly, given the importance of photos to Facebook, they have invested a lot of money in facial recognition. “Reading” photos with machines is quite an advance in the current artificial intelligence era.'
