      text3: 'In 1900, Planck first proposed the discontinuity of energy in his paper, kicking open the door of quantum mechanics. In the quantum world, all matter can be reduced to 61 kinds of elementary particles. The heaviest elementary particle has a mass of no more than 3.1×10 -25 kg.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In the 1940s, Turing precisely defined the meaning of algorithms and described what we now call Turing machine: a single general-purpose programmable computing device that can execute any algorithm. Since then, computers have gradually developed into an industry and profoundly changed our lives.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In 1981, the famous physicist Feynman observed many difficulties encountered by ordinary computers based on the Turing model in simulating quantum mechanical systems, and then proposed the idea of classical computers simulating quantum systems. When quantum physics and computing machines met in a narrow way, in 1985, the concept of universal quantum computers was finally born.\n' +
        '   \n' +
        'Since then, quantum mechanics has entered the process of rapid transformation into real social technology, and human beings have moved faster and faster on the road of quantum computing application development. Nowadays, quantum computing is no longer far away from us.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'From classical computing to quantum computing\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Generally speaking, quantum computing is a new computing model that follows the laws of quantum mechanics to regulate quantum information units for computing. It is completely different from existing computing models. When understanding the concept of quantum computing, it is usually compared with classical computing.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In classic computers, the basic unit of information is Bit. All the things that these computers do can be decomposed into 0s and 1s patterns, and simple operations of 0s and 1s.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Similar to the way traditional computers are composed of bits, quantum computers are composed of quantum bits or qubits, and a qubit corresponds to a state. However, the state of a bit is a number (0 or 1), while the state of a qubit is a vector. More specifically, the state of the qubit is a vector in a two-dimensional vector space. This vector space is called the state space.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Classical calculations use binary digital electronic methods to perform operations, and binary is always in a certain state of 0 or 1. Therefore, quantum computing can realize the superposition of computing states with the help of the superposition property of quantum mechanics. That is, it not only contains 0 and 1, but also contains the superposition of 0 and 1 at the same time.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'A 2-bit register in an ordinary computer can only store one binary number (one of 00, 01, 10, 11) at a time, while a 2-bit qubit register in a quantum computer can maintain the superposition of all 4 states at the same time. When the number of qubits is n, the quantum processor performing one operation on n qubits is equivalent to performing 2n operations on the classical bits. \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In addition, coupled with the characteristics of quantum entanglement, quantum computers will theoretically have faster processing speeds and stronger processing capabilities on some specific problems than classical computers currently using the strongest algorithms.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'How many possibilities are there in quantum computing?\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of subatomic particles. The use of mysterious quantum mechanics of quantum computers has surpassed the characteristics of the limits of classical Newtonian physics. It has become the scientific and technological community for a long time to achieve exponential growth in computing power. dream.\n' +
        'Quantum computing provides attractive possibilities for future scientific and technological development. Researchers trying to use the power of this new hardware mainly start with three types of problems.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The first type of problem involves analyzing the natural world: using quantum computers to simulate the behavior of molecules with precision that today’s computers cannot match. Among them, computational chemistry is the largest application field. In fact, in the past two years, the value of quantum computers in replacing guesswork with more and more empirical evidence has increased.\n' +
        '  \n' +
        'For example, simulating a relatively basic molecule (such as caffeine) would require a traditional computer with 10 to 48 bits, which is equivalent to 10% of the number of atoms on the earth. The analog penicillin requires 10 to the 86th power of bits-this number is greater than the total number of atoms in the observable universe.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Traditional computers will never be able to handle such tasks, but in the quantum field, such calculations are possible. In theory, a quantum computer with 160 qubits can simulate caffeine, while simulating penicillin requires 286 qubits. This provides a more convenient means for designing new materials or finding better ways to deal with existing processes.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'On August 27th, the Google quantum research team announced that it had simulated the largest chemical reaction to date on a quantum computer. Related results appeared on the cover of "Science" magazine, entitled "Hartree-Fock on a Superconducting Qubit Quantum Computer" .\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In order to complete this latest achievement, the researchers used the Sycamore processor to simulate the isomerization reaction of a diazene molecule composed of two nitrogen atoms and two hydrogen atoms. In the end, the quantum simulation was consistent with the simulation performed by the researchers on a classical computer, verifying their work.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'It is worth mentioning that the Sycamore used in this new research is exactly the 54-qubit processor considered by Nature to be a milestone in the history of quantum computing. Although this kind of chemical reaction may be relatively simple and is not something that a non-quantum computer can do, it shows the great potential of using quantum simulation to develop new chemical substances.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In addition, quantum computing is also expected to bring more benefits to artificial intelligence. Currently, potential applications of quantum algorithms for artificial intelligence include quantum neural networks, natural language processing, traffic optimization, and image processing. Among them, quantum neural network, as a research field formed by the intersection of quantum science, information science, and cognitive science, can use the powerful computing power of quantum computing to improve the information processing ability of neural computing.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In terms of natural language processing, in April 2020, Cambridge Quantum Computing Corporation announced the success of the natural language processing test performed on quantum computers. This is the first successful verification of quantum natural language processing applications worldwide. Researchers use the "intrinsic quantum" structure of natural language to translate sentences with grammar into quantum circuits, realize the process of program processing on quantum computers, and get answers to questions in sentences. The use of quantum computing is expected to achieve a further breakthrough in "semantic perception" in natural language processing.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Finally, it is the optimization possibilities of quantum computing for complex problems, and these complex problems often have too many variables for today\'s computers. For example, one use of quantum computing on complex issues is to build better financial market models. Enhancing encryption by inventing new numbers and improving operational efficiency in chaotic and complex areas such as transaction clearing and reconciliation. Including the pricing of derivatives, the optimization of investment portfolios, and the management of risks in highly complex and constantly changing circumstances, quantum systems can all handle things.'

      text3: 'A new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows that 2020 is the year when the central bank digital currency (CBDC) development momentum really takes off.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The new working paper of the Bank for International Settlements was released on August 24, analyzing the global status, technical methods and policy positions of CBDC research and development. This comprehensive study draws on more than 16,000 central bank speeches in recent years, assessing the current design of CBDC and the motivation behind the adoption of the new model by countries.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The report states, “In the past year, people’s attitudes towards whether central banks should issue (CBDC) have changed significantly.” Their research included an analysis of long-term public interest in CBDC. BIS data shows that in 2020, global Internet searches for CBDC will significantly exceed Bitcoin (BTC) and Facebook Libra searches.\n' +

        'The Bank for International Settlements report: 2020 is the year when the central bank\'s digital currency takes off. These data confirm the report\'s statement that although the concept of CBDC was put forward decades ago, it will not be until 2020 that CBDC has attracted global attention.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'BIS provides several hypotheses to explain why this is the case. First, it pointed out that the announcement of Libra by Facebook in 2019 and the subsequent response of the public sector was a clear “tipping point”.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Further data confirms this: as of the end of 2019, “central banks representing one-fifth of the world’s population reported that they may issue CBDC soon.” In addition, in 2019, retail CBDC may be issued in the medium term (1-6 years) The proportion of central banks in China has doubled.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'According to BIS analysis, a key factor accelerating this trend is the arrival of the new coronavirus pandemic.\n' +

        '"Social distancing measures, public concerns about the possibility of cash spreading the new crown pneumonia virus, and the new government\'s personal payment plan have further accelerated the transition to digital payments."\n' +

In the Netherlands, China, and Sweden, central banks have made CBDC research a high priority during the pandemic.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In BIS\'s view, all these factors are sufficient to overcome the typical "big inertia" in retail payment behavior. However, on the other hand, there is a lasting impact: "When behavior changes, they tend to change continuously. Similarly, changes in payment behavior caused by the new crown pneumonia crisis, such as greater use of digital payments, may have far-reaching consequences in the future. Impact." \n' +

        'A few days ago, Microsoft announced that it plans to abolish nearly 80 outsourced editors at the end of June. The AI ​​editor will be responsible for the subsequent news crawling, typesetting, and image matching of the MSN website. But I didn\'t expect that not long after arriving at the post, the AI editor "rolled over" and made a very low-level mistake.

        '\n' +
        'Face recognition technology is currently recognized as a relatively mature technology in the AI ​​field. People in the circle are also keen to brush up the accuracy of face recognition to new highs, the highest claimed accuracy rate can reach 99.9%. Face recognition technology has such a brilliant record, why is this AI editor still blind?\n' +
        '\n' +
        '"The working principle of face recognition technology is mainly to compare the facial features and facial features." Professor Han Yahong of the Department of Intelligence and Computing at Tianjin University explained. Simply put, it is based on the big data of the face image. Preprocessing is performed to extract features of various aspects of the face, and multiple extractions are carried out by layering to find the most effective feature expression for identifying individual faces.\n' +
        '\n' +
        ' Face recognition technology has undergone major changes over the years, and traditional face recognition methods have been replaced by deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks. The main advantage of deep learning methods is that they can be trained on large-scale data sets to learn the best features of these data.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '"Although you can use large-scale data sets for training, the current accuracy of 99.9% is basically the result of testing on some benchmark data sets. This data set must have a range, if the collected data is in the data set Within the range of distribution, a relatively high accuracy rate can be obtained." Han Yahong said.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'It is understood that the current claim that the accuracy of face recognition has reached more than 99% refers to the results of the comparison test with the world\'s most authoritative face database LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild). LFW can be regarded as a question bank for testing the face recognition capabilities of deep learning systems. It extracts 6000 face photos with different orientations, expressions and lighting environments from the Internet as test questions, allowing any system to "run points" in it. The "run score" process is that LFW gives a pair of photos and asks the test system if the two photos are the same person, and the system gives a yes or no answer.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '"It is not difficult to solve the specific face blindness problem. In fact, it is to re-target the task, collect the face images in the task field, train on the original algorithm model, or redesign the new algorithm model for training, will improve face recognition To meet the needs of practical applications.” Han Yahong said, but beyond the specific task, AI’s “face blindness” will recur. At present, there is no general model algorithm that can solve all tasks, but AI can improve the accuracy of face recognition through continuous adjustment and a lot of learning.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Deep neural network model is a necessary condition for advanced\n' +
        '\n' +
        '"At present, AI editors are relatively handy in analyzing and processing news documents." Han Yahong said, specifically, for example, in a very long report, let the AI ​​editor pick out the key points, which is no problem. Now is the era of multimedia, a large number of news reports will involve pictures and videos. AI editors can automatically extract pictures or videos, and then select text descriptions that match them from large-length text reports. This work AI is comparable Do it accurately.\n' +
        '\n' +
        ' "To solve problems in specific fields, AI is usually no problem, but it is more difficult to achieve generalization." Han Yahong emphasized that realizing these functions requires technologies in fields such as natural language processing, pattern recognition, image and video understanding.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'To train an AI editor, you first need to collect a lot of news reports, pictures and videos, and then design a deep neural network model for this task based on the collected data. There will be many parameters in the network model, and then the parameters are trained through the data. , It has all the editing capabilities originally set. In the use process, as the AI ​​editor learns more news, its business capabilities and performance will continue to improve.'

With the stakes being economic and military supremacy and control of technologies that can be applied for social control, the U.S. has moved to counter the PRC threat and maintain its AI dominance.\n' +

        '“Despite China’s bold AI initiative, the United States still leads in absolute terms; China comes in second, and the European Union lags further behind,” said the 106-page report, titled “Who is Winning the AI Race: China, the EU or the United States?\n' +

        'The PRC’s State Council released a strategic plan in 2017 to rival the U.S. in AI by 2020 and assume world leadership in AI technology by 2025, although the plan didn’t specify what such leadership might look like.

        'Castro: This administration’s efforts are starting to gain steam. The executive order has kicked off a series of actions that will lead toward meaningful improvements in how the federal government lays the foundations for future work on AI. In addition, the recent [September 2019] White House AI summit was an important catalyzing event to spur enthusiasm and momentum across federal agencies to pursue their own AI efforts independently. As the administration makes it clear that there is top-level support for this work, more people in government will start making this a priority. Also creating AI.gov will help.\n' +

        'FORUM: How do you think the U.S. strategy could be expanded?\n' +
        '   \n' +
        'Castro: There is always more work to be done. One area is funding. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to get a clear sense of how much some other governments are pouring into AI R&D, yet it is substantial. Congress needs to prioritize additional funding to supplement what the private sector provides and the “business as usual” funding it already offers to computer science and related disciplines. There is also a need to better track this funding across different agencies, particularly in relation to the various AI R&D priorities that the administration has identified. A lot of R&D on AI will not come from the National Science Foundation, but from the Department of Energy, Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation and other federal agencies. In addition, the U.S. government should consider joint funding initiatives with allies around the globe to foster research collaboration.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'FORUM: How important is the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) to U.S. competitiveness in AI?\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Castro: The JAIC will be especially important in the near-term as a lack of talent in the Defense Department [DOD] constrains what defense agencies can do with AI. By consolidating expertise, DOD can better prioritize projects, focus on solving scaling issues, and develop a culture of AI-driven innovation within DOD.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'FORUM: What is the bottom line of your recent report from the Center for Data Innovation?\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Castro: The U.S. has an early lead in artificial intelligence, but China is gaining fast, and if the U.S. does not commit the resources necessary to compete, it will squander its early lead. The implications of falling behind in AI could have seriously negative implications for the U.S. economy, national security, and overall global competitiveness. Many other countries are making AI a priority, and the U.S. needs to do so as well.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'FORUM: Are most people aware that the U.S. still leads China in absolute terms? Were your findings surprising in any way?\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Castro: Although it’s important to note that this is a snapshot, and while we are using the most recent data, some of it is still about a year out of date. And even over the past few years, we have seen China making significant strides forward, so the gap between the countries is narrowing quickly. Moreover, both the U.S. and China have a lot of focus on using AI in the military, and much of that work cannot be publicly compared.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'But one of the most significant factors is that China leads in adoption of AI, especially around piloting the technology. And public polls show that Chinese citizens generally are optimistic about AI. So, China has the wind at its back as it pursues ever more ambitious AI initiatives. In contrast, the U.S. public is more pessimistic about the potential of AI, which likely limits the willingness of lawmakers to pursue the technology.'

      text3: 'For decades, amateur two-way radio operators have chosen the right radio frequency at the right time of day in order to communicate across continents. The luxury to do this is because there are relatively few users and devices that share radio waves. But with the popularity of cellular radios in phones and Internet of Things devices, it becomes increasingly difficult to find interference-free frequencies.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Therefore, the researchers plan to use deep learning to create cognitive radios, which can be adjusted immediately to obtain the best performance.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Researchers from the Northeastern University Wireless Internet of Things Research Institute in the United States explained that the increasing variety and density of cellular Internet of Things devices have brought new challenges to wireless network optimization.\n' +
        '   \n' +
        'A given radio frequency range can be shared by one hundred small radio devices designed to work in the same overall area. Each small radio device has its own signaling characteristics and can adapt to changing conditions. . When predicting which spectrum fragments are available at a given moment, such a large number of devices reduces the power of the fixed mathematical model.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'This is where deep learning can help. Researchers hope to use embedded machine learning technology in wireless device hardware to improve frequency utilization, so that devices can develop their own AI-optimized spectrum usage strategies.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Early studies have shown that the classification accuracy of deep learning models is 20% higher than traditional systems on average when dealing with noisy radio channels, and can be extended to hundreds of devices running simultaneously, not just dozens. In addition, the deep learning architecture developed for this purpose will also be used for many other tasks.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'As a key point of implementing deep learning for this application is that large amounts of data need to be processed quickly for continuous analysis. Deep learning may rely on tens of millions of parameters, and here may need to measure more than 100 megabytes of data per second on the millisecond level.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The researchers pointed out that this computing requirement exceeds the capabilities of "even the most powerful embedded devices currently available." The low latency requirement in the task makes this calculation impossible to process in the cloud.\n' +

Weisse Arena Gruppe (English) operates the resort called Flims Laax Falera (English), and the company currently issues these shares on the distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. Loyal customers of the ski resort (for example, those who purchase annual ski passes) can also obtain shares in the company.\n' +
        'The fate of other local commercial organizations, and even housing prices, are closely linked to the success of this resort. The purpose of their issuance of digital shares is to establish closer ties with the local community, and to attract more repeat customers by allowing customers to share profits and participate in future strategies.\n' +
        'Exploring the technology of Bitcoin and blockchain\n' +
        'This content was published on April 22, 2019, April 22, 2019  Some people think this is just hype; others see this as a revolutionary technology that can completely change the way we trade almost everything of value. So what exactly is this so-called distributed ledger technology (DLT)? How does it work? Who can benefit from it? In the video below, we will distinguish between fact and fiction for you and help you see the smoke screen of hype. \n' +
        'The secret weapon of DLT platform (such as blockchain) is to allow a group of people to safely share data (whether it is money, financial instruments, or personal information) directly.\n' +
        'This digital system avoids paying middlemen to act as audits and referees between the parties to the transaction, but allows users to jointly negotiate the validity of the data. This guarantees the immediacy of settlement (no longer needs several days) and reduces costs. Weisse Arena Gruppe is issuing shares through the Daura (English) share registration platform, which is supported by the DLT system of the telecom giant Swisscom (Multilingual). The so-called "encrypted shares" are embedded with a kind of "smart contract", that is, a computer code that can replace the functions of brokers, custodian banks, and other intermediaries when buying and selling. This allows sellers and buyers to have direct contact, enabling instant peer-to-peer transactions.\n' +
        'The ski resort also plans to issue its own cryptocurrency GURU (Greatest User Return Unit), which is personal money that can be used in this resort. If guests exchange Swiss francs for GURU to pay, they can enjoy discounts at restaurants or other facilities in the resort.\n' +

        'Blockchain real estate\n' +
        'In March of this year, 20% of the assets of a building in the Swiss town of Zug were converted into digital shares. Through a blockchain platform, four investors bought these shares for 3 million Swiss francs. This is the first digital operation and transaction of property assets in Switzerland, and perhaps others will follow suit in the near future.\n' +
        'The digital token representing the ownership of this property was issued through the blockimmo (English) platform. Elea Labs (English) has ensured that these real estate data are true and valid. In the execution of this transaction, a cryptocurrency linked to the Swiss franc at a 1:1 ratio was used, and the cryptocurrency was issued by Swiss Crypto Tokens (English). This so-called "stable currency" can avoid the dramatic price fluctuations associated with other cryptocurrencies.\n' +
        'Many tasks currently performed by intermediaries (lawyers, notaries, etc.) can be replaced by "smart contracts", which can make transactions faster or make rental income distributed to dividends faster. Another advantage is that since the digital shares of real estate can be easily divided into smaller shares, investors with less capital can also join in real estate investment.\n' +
        'For the ownership of a property, the blockchain can provide all participants with a historical record arranged in chronological order, and the real-time update of the record will only take effect when all parties to the transaction agree. At present, the Swiss law is making corresponding adjustments to recognize transactions that only have digital stocks in the absence of handwritten signatures.\n' +
        'Paperwork terminator\n' +
        'Starting a company requires a lot of paperwork and a large number of third-party agencies to approve each stage of the process. A consortium of legal businesses partnered with blockchain service providers Proxeus (middle) and IBM (multilingual) to reduce the time required to create a company from a few weeks to a few days.\n' +
        'In a trial last year, they completed the creation of the first company Drakkensberg within two hours. To a large extent, this is due to their special agreement with the bank to speed up financial transactions, but even without this arrangement, they can complete the creation of other companies within 48 hours.\n' +

It is no longer necessary to wait for the completion of each registration process. Blockchain provides all participants with a complete overview of the entire process, making the process Multiple steps in can be performed simultaneously.\n' +
        'They ambitiously set a goal of establishing 100,000 companies by the end of August. At present, the lawyers participating in the trial have paid their working hours without pay. Therefore, one of their goals is to transform this process into permanent commercial services.\n' +

An ordinary sea freight can produce a total of 240 documents, including 36 original documents, distributed among 27 intermediaries.\n' +
        'The DLT network uses algorithms to enable transaction parties to reach an agreement on the validity of data without the need for intermediaries. If the parties to a transaction hold identical copies of the same data, they can immediately agree on this, which speeds up the process and avoids disputes in the future.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'All parties keep their sensitive data behind the firewall, and when necessary, they can send relevant information directly to other users in the network.\n' +
        'This network can also build a real-time image like a jigsaw puzzle to show the progress of the ship\'s transportation to all parties involved in the freight.\n' +
        'Headquartered in Geneva, the network was put into use at the beginning of this year, and it better connects traders and banks (to finance shipping). It also cooperates with the Vakt DLT platform in London, which is responsible for handling other business on the commodity trading chain.'

If you just want to do a basic feedforward convolutional neural network, GPU is a very good solution, but as the network becomes more and more complex, people need brand new solutions, perhaps this is why ASIC and FPGA are needed. \n' +
        '\n' +
        'With the continuous development of deep learning technology, the use of GPUs may hinder innovative ideas, because recurrent neural networks and other types of structures, such as reinforcement learning, cannot be properly mapped on the GPU. The research field is limited due to the lack of a good hardware platform, which is why Graphcore wants to market IPU to the market.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The 16-nanometer "Colossus" IPU launched by Graphcore contains 24 billion transistors, more than 1,200 low-precision floating-point arithmetic cores and all control operations and transcendental functions required for machine learning, and 125 teraFLOPS computing power. Each core can run up to 6 threads, so for a 4U rack (8 C2 PCIe cards, each C2 card contains two IPUs), there can be 100,000 independent threads in parallel. Graphcore claims that its data processing and processing architecture can reach up to 100 times the efficiency of today\'s most powerful GPU.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'IPU is a processor specially designed for AI. It has powerful parallel processing capabilities, establishes a fast training model, and realizes real-time control, which enables Graphcore to make significant progress in natural language processing, which is also the difference between IPU processors An important factor for other processors.'

      text2: '2020-1-7',
      text3: 'The Trump administration is proposing new rules to guide future federal regulation of artificial intelligence used in medicine, transportation and other industries.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'But the vagueness of the principles announced by the White House is unlikely to satisfy AI watchdogs who have warned of a lack of accountability as computer systems are deployed to take on human roles in high-risk social settings, such as mortgage lending or job recruitment.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The White House said that in deciding regulatory action, U.S. agencies “must consider fairness, non-discrimination, openness, transparency, safety, and security.” But federal agencies must also avoid setting up restrictions that “needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth,” reads a memo being sent to U.S. agency chiefs from Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n' +
        '   \n' +
        '“Agencies must avoid a precautionary approach that holds AI systems to such an impossibly high standard that society cannot enjoy their benefits,” the memo says.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The rules won’t affect how federal agencies such as law enforcement use facial recognition and other forms of AI. They are specifically limited to how federal agencies devise new AI regulations for the private sector. There’s a 60-day public comment period before the rules take effect.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“These principles are intentionally high-level,” said Lynne Parker, U.S. deputy chief technology officer at the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. “We purposely wanted to avoid top-down, one-size-fits-all, blanket regulations.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The White House said the proposals unveiled Tuesday are meant to promote private sector applications of AI that are safe and fair, while also pushing back against stricter regulations favored by some lawmakers and activists.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration will be bound to follow the new AI principles. That makes the rules “the first of their kind from any government,” Michael Kratsios, the U.S. chief technology officer, said in a call with reporters Monday.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Rapid advancements in AI technology have raised fresh concern as computers increasingly take on jobs such as diagnosing medical conditions, driving cars, recommending stock investments, judging credit risk and recognizing individual faces in video footage. It’s often not clear how AI systems make their decisions, leading to questions of how far to trust them and when to keep humans in the loop.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Terah Lyons of the nonprofit Partnership on AI, which advocates for responsible AI and has backing from major tech firms and philanthropies, said the White House principles won’t likely have sweeping or immediate effects. But she said she was encouraged that they detailed a U.S. approach centered on values such as trustworthiness and fairness.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“The AI developer community may see that as a positive step in the right direction,” said Lyons, who previously worked for the White House science and technology office during the Obama administration. “It’s a little bit hard to see what the actual impact will be.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'What’s missing, she added, are clear mechanisms for holding AI systems accountable.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Another tech watchdog, New York University’s AI Now Institute, said it welcomed new boundaries on AI applications but it “will take time to assess how effective these principles are in practice.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Kratsios said he hopes the new principles can serve as a template for other democratic institutions such as the European Commission, which has put forward its own AI ethical guidelines, to preserve shared values without impeding the tech industry.\n' +
        '  \n' +
        '\n' +
        'That, he said, is“the best way to counter authoritarian uses of AI” by governments that aim to “track, surveil and imprison their own people.” The Trump administration has sought to penalize China over the past year over AI uses the U.S. considers abusive.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The U.S. Commerce Department last year blacklisted several Chinese AI firms after the Trump administration said they were implicated in the repression of Muslims in the country’s Xinjiang region. On Monday, citing national security concerns, the agency set limits on exporting AI software used to analyze satellite imagery.'

      text1: 'The Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Trends Everyone Should Be Watching In 2020',
      text2: '2020-1-6',
      text3: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been the technology story of the 2010s, and it doesn\'t look like the excitement is going to wear off as a new decade dawns.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The past decade will be remembered as the time when machines that can truly be thought of as “intelligent” – as in capable of thinking, and learning, like we do – started to become a reality outside of science fiction.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'While no prediction engine has yet been built that can plot the course of AI over the coming decade, we can be fairly certain about what might happen over the next year. Spending on research, development, and deployment continues to rise, and debate over the wider social implications rages on. Meanwhile, the incentives only get bigger for those looking to roll out AI-driven innovation into new areas of industry, fields of science, and our day-to-day lives.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Here are my predictions for what we\'re likely to see continue or emerge in the first year of the 2020s.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '\n' +
        '1. AI will increasingly be monitoring and refining business processes\n' +
        '\n' +
        'While the first robots in the workplace were mainly involved with automating manual tasks such as manufacturing and production lines, today\'s software-based robots will take on the repetitive but necessary work that we carry out on computers. Filling in forms, generating reports and diagrams and producing documentation and instructions are all tasks that can be automated by machines that watch what we do and learn to do it for us in a quicker and more streamlined manner. This automation – known as robotic process automation – will free us from the drudgery of time-consuming but essential administrative work, leaving us to spend more time on complex, strategic, creative and interpersonal tasks.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '2. More and more personalization will take place in real-time\n' +
        '\n' +
        'This trend is driven by the success of internet giants like Amazon, Alibaba, and Google, and their ability to deliver personalized experiences and recommendations. AI allows providers of goods and services to quickly and accurately project a 360-degree view of customers in real-time as they interact through online portals and mobile apps, quickly learning how their predictions can fit our wants and needs with ever-increasing accuracy. Just as pizza delivery companies like Dominos will learn when we are most likely to want pizza, and make sure the "Order Now" button is in front of us at the right time, every other industry will roll out solutions aimed at offering personalized customer experiences at scale.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '3. AI becomes increasingly useful as data becomes more accurate and available\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The quality of information available is often a barrier to businesses and organizations wanting to move towards AI-driven automated decision-making. But as technology and methods of simulating real-world processes and mechanisms in the digital domain have improved over recent years, accurate data has become increasingly available. Simulations have advanced to the stage where car manufacturers and others working on the development of autonomous vehicles can gain thousands of hours of driving data without vehicles even leaving the lab, leading to huge reductions in cost as well as increases in the quality of data that can be gathered. Why risk the expense and danger of testing AI systems in the real world when computers are now powerful enough, and trained on accurate-enough data, to simulate it all in the digital world? 2020 will see an increase in the accuracy and availability of real-world simulations, which in turn will lead to more powerful and accurate AI.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '4. More devices will run AI-powered technology\n' +
        '\n' +
        'As the hardware and expertise needed to deploy AI become cheaper and more available, we will start to see it used in an increasing number of tools, gadgets, and devices. In 2019 we’re already used to running apps that give us AI-powered predictions on our computers, phones, and watches. As the next decade approaches and the cost of hardware and software continues to fall, AI tools will increasingly be embedded into our vehicles, household appliances, and workplace tools. Augmented by technology such as virtual and augmented reality displays, and paradigms like the cloud and Internet of Things, the next year will see more and more devices of every shape and size starting to think and learn for themselves. \n' +
        '\n' +
        '5. Human and AI cooperation increases\n' +
        '\n' +
        'More and more of us will get used to the idea of working alongside AI-powered tools and bots in our day-to-day working lives. Increasingly, tools will be built that allow us to make the most of our human skills – those which AI can\'t quite manage yet – such as imaginative, design, strategy, and communication skills. While augmenting them with super-fast analytics abilities fed by vast datasets that are updated in real-time.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'For many of us, this will mean learning new skills, or at least new ways to use our skills alongside these new robotic and software-based tools. The IDC predicts that by 2025, 75% of organizations will be investing in employee retraining in order to fill skill gaps caused by the need to adopt AI. This trend will become increasingly apparent throughout 2020, to the point where if your employer isn’t investing in AI tools and training, it might be worth considering how well placed they are to grow over the coming years.  \n' +
        '\n' +
        '6. AI increasingly at the “edge”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Much of the AI we’re used to interacting with now in our day-to-day lives takes place “in the cloud” – when we search on Google or flick through recommendations on Netflix, the complex, data-driven algorithms run on high-powered processors inside remote data centers, with the devices in our hands or on our desktops simply acting as conduits for information to pass through.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Increasingly, however, as these algorithms become more efficient and capable of running on low-power devices, AI is taking place at the "edge," close to the point where data is gathered and used. This paradigm will continue to become more popular in 2020 and beyond, making AI-powered insights a reality outside of the times and places where super-fast fiber optic and mobile networks are available. Custom processors designed to carry out real-time analytics on-the-fly will increasingly become part of the technology we interact with day-to-day, and increasingly we will be able to do this even if we have patchy or non-existent internet connections.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '7. AI increasingly used to create films, music, and games\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Some things, even in 2020, are probably still best left to humans. Anyone who has seen the current state-of-the-art in AI-generated music, poetry or storytelling is likely to agree that the most sophisticated machines still have some way to go until their output will be as enjoyable to us as the best that humans can produce. However, the influence of AI on entertainment media is likely to increase. This year we saw Robert De Niro de-aged in front of our eyes with the assistance of AI, in Martin Scorsese’s epic The Irishman, and the use of AI in creating brand new visual effects and trickery is likely to become increasingly common.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In videogames, AI will continue to be used to create challenging, human-like opponents for players to compete against, as well as to dynamically adjust gameplay and difficulty so that games can continue to offer a compelling challenge for gamers of all skill levels. And while completely AI-generated music may not be everyone’s cup of tea, where AI does excel is in creating dynamic soundscapes – think of smart playlists on services like Spotify or Google Music that match tunes and tempo to the mood and pace of our everyday lives.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '8. AI will become ever more present in cybersecurity\n' +
        '\n' +
        'As hacking, phishing and social engineering attacks become ever-more sophisticated, and themselves powered by AI and advanced prediction algorithms, smart technology will play an increasingly important role in protecting us from these attempted intrusions into our lives. AI can be used to spot giveaway signs that digital activity or transactions follow patterns that are likely to be indicators of nefarious activity, and raise alarms before defenses can be breached and sensitive data compromised.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The rollout of 5G and other super-fast wireless communications technology will bring huge opportunities for businesses to provide services in new and innovative ways, but they will also potentially open us up to more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Spending on cybersecurity will continue to increase, and those with relevant skills will be highly sought-after.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '9. More of us will interact with AI, maybe without even knowing it\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Let’s face it, despite the huge investment in recent years in natural-language powered chatbots in customer service, most of us can recognize whether we’re dealing with a robot or a human. However, as the datasets used to train natural language processing algorithms continue to grow, the line between humans and machines will become harder and harder to distinguish. With the advent of deep learning and semi-supervised models of machine learning such as reinforcement learning, the algorithms that attempt to match our speech patterns and infer meaning from our own human language will become more and more able to fool us into thinking there is a human on the other end of the conversation. And while many of us may think we would rather deal with a human when looking for information or assistance, if robots fill their promise of becoming more efficient and accurate at interpreting our questions, that could change. Given the ongoing investment and maturation of the technology powering customer service bots and portals, 2020 could be the first time many of us interact with a robot without even realizing it. \n' +
        '\n' +
        '10. But AI will recognize us, even if we don’t recognize it\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Perhaps even more unsettlingly, the rollout of facial recognition technology is only likely to intensify as we move into the next decade. Not just in China (where the government is looking at ways of making facial recognition compulsory for accessing services like communication networks and public transport) but around the world. Corporations and governments are increasingly investing in these methods of telling who we are and interpreting our activity and behavior. There\'s some pushback against this – this year, San Francisco became the first major city to ban the use of facial recognition technology by the police and municipal agencies, and others are likely to follow in 2020. But the question of whether people will ultimately begin to accept this intrusion into their lives, in return for the increased security and convenience it will bring, is likely to be a hotly debated topic of the next 12 months.'

        '1. Siri and Alexa\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Voice assistants are playing a more and more important role in business running. Their challenge is to understand human language, but it’s even harder to understand humans.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'That’s why artificial intelligence exists. AI system engineers can build those voice assistants, but they cannot embed too many human attributes into them in the release. So, AI systems require extensive use of machine learning to enable them to better complete the highly complex task of human-machine interfaces. With the help of AI, voice assistants are more and more capable of searching the internet to help people shopping and provide navigation. Voice technology is expected to play a vital role in home assistants such as taking care of people. It is one of the countless examples of AI voice recognition.\n' +

        '2. Amazon and online business\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The concept of a system that responds to customer input is not an example of AI. For instance, applications that recommend shirt ads after detecting the user’s browsing history may not be advanced AI applications.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Take the Amazon recommendation system as an example, it’s a powerful engine for the transactional AI platform. People might have realized its ability to keep learning. Actually, massive shoppers are “coaching” the Amazon AI system to better display the selling goods. In other words, we put the related goods(such as light stands and photographic equipment) together to boost sales and link semi-related concepts.\n' +
        '\n' +

        'Artificial intelligence can make massive calculations in real-time. Without a machine learning system to analyze and route the result data to user and driver applications, the number and complexity of these calculations would be impossible. However, Lyft and Uber record it on their systems. They have a lot of data about user mode.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In the future, the era of self-driving is expected(though this situation is still ambiguous). Without the element of the human driver, the process of running the system would be more of logic machine learning calculations. Theoretically, this will lead to a decrease in ride-sharing costs and may save the cost of hiring drivers.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '12. Social network\n' +
        '\n' +
        'The key driving force of AI development is the main social media networks. In particular, Facebook seems to have adopted all aspects of artificial intelligence. For example, its algorithm defines a user’s timeline and decides whether to show certain posts of his friends or not. Facebook knows that if all friends post of a user is shown, the timeline will be so messy that it will be boring. As a result, the timeline algorithm can learn about who the user is interacting with the people they usually ignore. \n' +
        '\n' +
        'For Facebook, the most important thing is that social networks use AI to help personalize the way they offer ads to users, so it has a certain ad display correlations. It should be noted that Facebook allows users to comment on the correlation between ads and the timeline. Each user comment helps the system learn and become finer. Due to the way they use AI to fine-tune the display system, Facebook and Google possess an extremely high percentage of the entire online advertising market.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Furthermore, Facebook uses artificial intelligence technology to identify faces in photos, so it can invite users to tag it. Not surprisingly, given the importance of photos to Facebook, they have invested a lot of money in facial recognition. “Reading” photos with machines is quite an advance in the current artificial intelligence era.'

      text3: 'As an expert study at a recent AI conference shown, AI can choose to perform any intellectual task that humans can do in 2050. At that time, intelligent machines can do everything without exception. However, artificial intelligence has done quite a few things from reading to recognizing. Artificial intelligence is now everywhere. Let’s see its outstanding performance.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Speaking\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Enabling individuals to chat with the machine is the long-term dream of human-machine collaboration. In recent years, the ability of PC to understand natural voice has changed through the use of deep neural systems(such as Google Voice Search).\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Google researchers have built a voice clone system with two information sources: what we need to read and reading examples. Google’s AI research, nicknamed Voice Clone, allows the computer to read aloud so that everyone can hear anything.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Vision\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Machines cannot see people’s behaviors,  but AI can act as the machine vision to help “see” the world, analyze visual information, and then make better decisions. Today the machine vision integrates self-driving vehicles, facial recognition, and payment and has been widely used in manufacturing to help predictive maintenance and product quality control.\n' +
        'Identify objects in images\n' +
        'Microsoft experts have made significant progress in identifying objects in images or videos. The system can meet the accuracy requirements. Sometimes it may exceed human performance.\n' +
        'Like other scientists in this field, Microsoft trains the computer to perceive images with deep neural networks. Their framework is geting more and more successful because it allows them to take advantage of incredible deep neural networks that are several times deeper than previously used.\n' +
        'Smelling\n' +
        'AI researchers are producing AI tools which identify various disease by smelling one’s breath. Forbes says it can distinguish synthetic substances considered to be aldehydes related to human disease and stress, such as cancer, diabetes, and brain trauma. It can even recognize the smell of wood or musk generated by Parkinson\'s disease before identifying other symptoms. AI robots can recognize gas leakage or other acid chemicals. In any case, IBM uses AI to create a new perfume.\n' +
        'New uses of existing pharmaceuticals\n' +
        'AI can also make it easier to find medicines for diseases that not currently focused on by existing medicines. Recursion uses software to read the results of high throughput screening. The screening can perform drug test automatically in cells. Recursion uses algorithm to investigate units at irregular levels of detail.

Fortune was provided an early look at the San Jose-based software company’s survey results.\n' +
        'Among the more than 200 CIOs that participated in Adobe’s October survey, none said they’re planning to scale back the use of A.I. or machine learning. That apparent confidence speaks to the success of recent AI breakthroughs.\n' +
        '“As a whole there are massive opportunities to adopt new [A.I.] technologies,” said Ronell Hugh, the product marketing lead for Adobe Experience Platform. “Cloud infrastructure was a first step, now there is a lot of innovation in AI and how to use data in real-time for your business.”\n' +

        'Among the leaders in using real-time data is the hospitality industry. Some hotel chains have algorithms that monitor customer feedback and make suggestions in real-time to hotel staff, Hugh says. If a hotel guest has complained in the past about towels, the algorithm might suggest staff double-check towels.'

        'For the medical industry, the US started to have electronic medical records more than 20 years ago, but they cannot gather all records together in medical systems across the country to provide a database for machine learning algorithms. The object reason is personal privacy protection by US law. However, it also has something to do with the “ castle” in the medical industry, isolated and self-financing. The situation in China is quite different.”Once the government decides to establish a database of electronic medical records across the country......it can be done.” Professor Michell calls on Washington DC to distinguish between win-win AI applications and those really sensitive and competitive AI technologies, such as military AI. He ‘s also concerned that populism arguments in Washington will isolate foreign scholars in the US academic and educational circles, many of whom are Chinese and have played a vital role in keeping the US leading position in science and technology in the world.'

Startups like D-ID and many previous works have already adopted de-identification technology to process the static image, but this technology is for video. In early tests, it can prevent the most advanced facial recognition system.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'AI for automatic video modification can be applied to every video without retraining. A slightly deformed version is mapped on the face to make it difficult for facial recognition technology to identify the person.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'An article explaining the method like this“Facial recognition can lead to a loss of privacy, and face replacement technology can be misused to make misleading videos. Recent world events about advances and abuses of facial recognition have created demands for de-identification. Our contribution is that it’s only applicable to video(including live video), and the quality presented has far exceeded literature methods”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Facebook’s method is to match the adversarial autoencoder and classifier network. As a part of network training, researchers want to fool the facial recognition network, Facebook AI research engineer and Tel Aviv University professor Lior Wolf told VentureBeat in a phone interview.\n' +
        '\n' +
        ' “So, the autoencoder will try to make it harder for the face-recognition network. Actually, if you want to generate a way to mask someone’s voice or online behaviors or any other method, the autoencoder also works. ”Wolf said.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'AI uses encoder-decoder architecture to generate images like FacesWap and Deepfake. In the training process, the face deforms and enters the network. Then, the system generates distorted and undistorted images to embed them in the video.\n' +

        'A spokesman told VentureBeat that Facebook still has no plans to apply the technology to any part of Facebook applications, and this method allows the public to recognize public speech but not AI systems.\n' +

        'Anonymous faces in the video can also be used for privacy-oriented training in AI systems.

        'Dash representatives will provide on-site training during the first two months of operations as part of the company’s efforts to onboard potential cryptocurrency users in the country, Panda Exchange partner Robert Mozo said in a press release.\n' +
        'Of the approximately 4,900 merchants that accept dash globally, nearly half are located in Venezuela, the press release said.\n' +
        'Much of this headway has been made by DiscoverDash, which began by offering dash training to smaller firms and family owned businesses, but has grown to attract more established enterprises.\n' +
        'Additional onboarding efforts were led by Dash Merchant Venezuela, which succeeded in making “business connections” by providing crypto-enabled POS to businesses, before shutting down for employee salary inconsistencies.\n' +
        '“We expect our partnership with Panda in Colombia and Farmarket in Venezuela to be a substantial move toward a purchase driven economy, where not only Venezuelans in Caracas will be able to pay directly in stores with Dash, but also their relatives in Colombia and elsewhere will be able to buy medicine from abroad and resolve health issues for their relatives and loved ones,” said Ryan Taylor, CEO, Dash Core Group, in a statement.\n' +
        'Venezuela is quickly becoming a hotbed for actual cryptocurrency use cases. In May inflation reached 815,000 percent, following a one year high above 1.7 million percent. Under these economic conditions, cryptocurrencies present a store of value as well as stable form of payment for citizens. XPay charges a 3.99 percent transaction fee.'
